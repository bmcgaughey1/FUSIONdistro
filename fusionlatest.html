<h2>"The Latest Version"</h2>

<center>
Version 4.50 is the latest version of FUSION. 
<hr width="100%">

<p>May 19, 2022 update</p>

<p>I have received several reports from people having trouble running FUSION and command line tools. They are getting an error
that indicates that a required component (mfc140.dll) is missing from their system. So far, this problem seems to be related
to a recent windows update and may be limited to specific brands of computers. You can fix the problem by downloading and
installing the Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributables from the following link. You will need to download and install
both the 32-bit (vc_redist.x86.exe) and the 64-bit (vc_redist.x86.exe) versions. </p>

<p><strong>Version 4.40 includes a few bug fixes and somewhat major changes regarding the logic used when working with 
DTM files with gaps between adjacent tiles and surface models with different resolutions.
Logic changes related to grid alignment when coordinates have negative values that only affect operations where X or Y values are negative.
Changes to "fix" problems using wildcards to specify files to command line problems. Windows expands wildcard searches like *.las to include files
with .lasx extension. This behavior has long caused problems. New logic has been added to all programs that use point data to drop non point files
from the set of input files built using the wildcard specifier.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">Version 4.30 includes a major bug fix for the GridMetrics program. Several of the intensity metrics were
being computed incorrectly when the /strata option was used. Namely the L-moment and percentile metrics. All intensity metrics were correct when the 
/strata option was not used on the command line. All users should update their version of FUSION.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">Version 4.20 fixes some major problems for all programs that write LAS/LAZ files. 
Basically everything worked if input files all used the same
version of the LAS format but when inputs included files of different versions, most tools that write LAS/LAZ files failed. The problem was
related to a mismatch in the version number and header size for the output file.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">The website for FUSION changed several years ago. The new site is <a
href="http://forsys.sefs.uw.edu/fusion/fusion_overview.html">http://forsys.sefs.uw.edu/fusion_overview.html</a>
Please update any bookmarks to reflect the new site. The old forsys.cfr.washington.edu site is
currently being redirected to the new site but this could end at any time.</span></strong></p>

<p>FUSION (V3.40+) supports reading and writing of compressed LAS data files by linking to Martin Isenburg's
LASzip.dll and LASzip64.dll libraries. To take advantage of this capability, you will eed to install
LAStools and manually copy the LASzip.dll and LASzip64.dll files into FUSION's install folder.</p>
</center>

<p style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">LAStools can
be found here: <a
href="http://rapidlasso.com/lastools/">http://rapidlasso.com/lastools/</a> or
here: <a href="http://lastools.org/">http://lastools.org/</a></p>

<center>
<p style="text-align:center;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">If you have an
earlier version of FUSION, you should upgrade to take advantage of several new
features and bug fixes. </p>

<p>If you are upgrading from version 4.00 or higher, you can simply install the new version of FUSION
to the same folder as the old version. To upgrade from older versions, first remove the old version by 
deleting the install folder. FUSION does not add components to any windows folders and it does not register an
"uninstaller" so it won't show up on the list of installed programs. Then install
the new version into the same folder as the previous version. If you have data or settings files in 
the FUSION install folder, you can just delete application files and application
extensions from the FUSION install folder instead of the entire folder and then prceed with the install.</p>
